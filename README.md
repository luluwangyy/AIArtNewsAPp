## Inspiration
This project first aims to spark discussions on "what makes human art human." Secondly, it serves as a tool for everyone to participate in the creation and curation of conceptual art.

Ultimately, I want to make the contemporary art world accessible to everyone, fostering collaborative thinking about the future of humanity and art.

## What I Created
I developed an interactive, multi-agent website inspired by the design of Artsy and Gagosian websites. The platform allows users to generate formal art news (including article title, artist bio, two AI-generated photographs of the work, labels, and description) by inputting just four words, using Socket.io, Python, JavaScript, and OpenAI, along with Replicate API integration.
